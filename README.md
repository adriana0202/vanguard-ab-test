1# Project Title: vanguard-ab-test
EDA and Data Cleaning Performance Metrics Hypothesis testing Experiment Evaluation Tableau Setup
The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

2# Description, overview of the project
The digital world is evolving, and so are Vanguard’s clients. Vanguard believed that a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could make the online process smoother for clients. The critical question was: Would these changes encourage more clients to complete the process?

An A/B test was set into motion from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017 by the team.

Control Group: Clients interacted with Vanguard’s traditional online process.
Test Group: Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.
Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.

The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

3# Installation: Instructions on how to install and set up the project locally. This may include dependencies that need to be installed.
We have attached a function_file.py to simplify the code. Note that on deepnote it was requiring extra import. As a secondary option the functions are within the code and can be run in the notebook appendices.
There are additional Tableau files to be used for further or more in detail analysis of the data.

4# Usage: Guidelines on how to use the project, including any configuration or setup required.
Not specific guideline.

5# Examples: Code examples or usage scenarios to illustrate how the project can be used.

6# Contributing: Guidelines for contributing to the project, including how to report bugs, suggest improvements, or submit code changes (e.g., through pull requests).

7# License: Information about the project's license, such as the type of license it is released under (e.g., MIT, Apache, GPL) and any terms and conditions for using the project.

8# Credits: Acknowledgment of any individuals or organizations that contributed to the project, as well as links to relevant resources or documentation.

9# Contact: Contact information for the project maintainers or contributors, such as email addresses or links to social media profiles.
